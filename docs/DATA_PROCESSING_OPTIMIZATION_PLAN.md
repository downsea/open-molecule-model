### Optimization Strategy

## Phase 1: Core Processing Engine Optimizations

### 1.1 Advanced Parallel Processing Architecture

**Current Issue**: Worker processes recreate RDKit objects repeatedly
**Solution**: Implement worker pool with persistent objects and shared memory

```python
# New architecture with persistent worker pools
class OptimizedWorkerPool:
    def __init__(self, num_workers, config):
        self.workers = []
        self.shared_config = multiprocessing.Manager().dict(config)
        self.result_queue = multiprocessing.Queue(maxsize=10000)
        self.task_queue = multiprocessing.Queue(maxsize=50000)
        
    def initialize_worker(self):
        # Pre-create RDKit objects once per worker
        global _worker_normalizer, _worker_uncharger, _worker_remover
        _worker_normalizer = rdMolStandardize.Normalizer()
        _worker_uncharger = rdMolStandardize.Uncharger()
        _worker_remover = SaltRemover.SaltRemover()
```

**Expected Performance Gain**: 40-60% faster processing

### 1.2 Vectorized Molecular Operations

**Current Issue**: Individual molecule processing in loops
**Solution**: Batch operations where possible

```python
def batch_process_molecules(smiles_batch: List[str], batch_size: int = 1000):
    # Process molecules in vectorized batches
    # Use numpy operations for numerical computations
    # Batch RDKit operations where possible
```

**Expected Performance Gain**: 25-35% faster for property calculations

### 1.3 Memory-Mapped File Processing

**Current Issue**: Sequential file reading
**Solution**: Memory-mapped files with parallel chunk processing

```python
def process_file_mmap(file_path: str, num_workers: int):
    with mmap.mmap(file.fileno(), 0, access=mmap.ACCESS_READ) as mmapped_file:
        # Split file into chunks for parallel processing
        # Each worker processes a memory-mapped chunk
```

**Expected Performance Gain**: 50-70% faster file I/O

## Phase 2: Data Structure Optimizations

### 2.1 High-Performance Deduplication

**Current Issue**: In-memory set operations for large datasets
**Solution**: Bloom filter + SQLite hybrid approach

```python
class HighPerformanceDeduplicator:
    def __init__(self, expected_items: int):
        # Use Bloom filter for fast negative lookups
        self.bloom_filter = BloomFilter(capacity=expected_items, error_rate=0.001)
        # SQLite for definitive storage
        self.db_connection = sqlite3.connect(":memory:")
        
    def is_duplicate(self, smiles: str) -> bool:
        # Fast Bloom filter check first
        if smiles not in self.bloom_filter:
            return False
        # Definitive SQLite check only if Bloom filter says "maybe"
        return self.check_sqlite(smiles)
```

**Expected Performance Gain**: 80-90% faster deduplication for large datasets

### 2.2 Optimized SELFIES Processing

**Current Issue**: Sequential SELFIES conversion
**Solution**: Cached conversion with parallel processing

```python
class CachedSELFIESProcessor:
    def __init__(self, cache_size: int = 100000):
        self.conversion_cache = LRUCache(maxsize=cache_size)
        self.vocab_cache = {}
        
    def batch_convert_to_selfies(self, smiles_list: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        # Use multiprocessing for SELFIES conversion
        # Cache results to avoid recomputation
```

**Expected Performance Gain**: 60-80% faster SELFIES processing

## Phase 3: I/O and Storage Optimizations

### 3.1 Asynchronous I/O Operations

**Current Issue**: Synchronous file operations blocking processing
**Solution**: Async I/O with producer-consumer pattern

```python
import asyncio
import aiofiles

async def async_file_processor(file_paths: List[str]):
    async def process_file(file_path):
        async with aiofiles.open(file_path, 'r') as f:
            async for line in f:
                yield line.strip()
    
    # Process multiple files concurrently
    tasks = [process_file(fp) for fp in file_paths]
    async for result in asyncio.as_completed(tasks):
        yield result
```

**Expected Performance Gain**: 40-60% faster file processing

### 3.2 Compressed Intermediate Storage

**Current Issue**: Large temporary files
**Solution**: Compressed storage with fast codecs

```python
import lz4.frame
import pickle

def save_compressed_chunk(molecules: List[str], output_file: str):
    # Use LZ4 compression for fast compression/decompression
    compressed_data = lz4.frame.compress(pickle.dumps(molecules))
    with open(output_file, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(compressed_data)
```

**Expected Performance Gain**: 70-80% smaller storage, 20-30% faster I/O

## Phase 4: Advanced Data Analysis Optimizations

### 4.1 Parallel Property Calculation

**Current Issue**: Sequential property calculations
**Solution**: Vectorized and parallel property computation

```python
def parallel_property_analysis(molecules: List[Chem.Mol], num_workers: int = 8):
    # Split molecules into chunks
    # Calculate properties in parallel
    # Use numpy for vectorized operations where possible
    
    with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=num_workers) as executor:
        futures = []
        for chunk in chunk_molecules(molecules, chunk_size=1000):
            future = executor.submit(calculate_properties_batch, chunk)
            futures.append(future)
```

**Expected Performance Gain**: 300-500% faster property analysis

### 4.2 Streaming Visualization Generation

**Current Issue**: Loading all data for visualization
**Solution**: Streaming data processing for plots

```python
def generate_streaming_plots(data_iterator, output_path: str):
    # Process data in chunks for visualization
    # Update plots incrementally
    # Use efficient plotting backends (e.g., Plotly with WebGL)
```

**Expected Performance Gain**: 60-80% less memory usage, 40% faster plotting

## Phase 5: System-Level Optimizations

### 5.1 NUMA-Aware Processing

**Current Issue**: Not optimized for multi-socket systems
**Solution**: NUMA topology awareness

```python
import psutil
import os

def optimize_for_numa():
    # Detect NUMA topology
    # Bind workers to specific NUMA nodes
    # Optimize memory allocation patterns
```

**Expected Performance Gain**: 20-40% on multi-socket systems

### 5.2 GPU-Accelerated Operations

**Current Issue**: CPU-only processing
**Solution**: GPU acceleration for suitable operations

```python
import cupy as cp  # GPU-accelerated numpy
import rapids_singlecell as rsc  # GPU-accelerated data processing

def gpu_accelerated_filtering(molecular_properties: np.ndarray):
    # Move data to GPU
    gpu_data = cp.asarray(molecular_properties)
    # Perform filtering operations on GPU
    # Return filtered results
```

**Expected Performance Gain**: 200-400% for suitable operations
